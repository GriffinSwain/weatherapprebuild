// Peer reviewed by Harrison Busby:
// Griffins website is decent. I like how his cards change colors depending on the weather and I like the background image. Another thing is that the current weather and the 5 day forecast populates information and shows the icons which is great!
// Now for the rough part. Griffins website is neither responsive nor does it have a favorites function. Also his cards for the 5 day forecast and his main box are very sharp. There is also no spacing between the cards which makes it rough to look at. Another tiny thing is it doesn't say the specific day of the week rather the date time. Also, when he fetches the information, sometimes you have to press the fetch button twice for it to populate information.
// All in all I think that Griffin's project is decent but if he had a little more time I think he could have made the changes I said above.
// Good job!





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
